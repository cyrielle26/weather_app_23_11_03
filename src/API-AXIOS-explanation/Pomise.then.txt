Promise.prototype.then()

The then() method of Promise instances 
takes up to two arguments: 
-callback functions for the fulfilled 
-rejected cases of the Promise. 
It immediately returns an equivalent Promise object,
allowing you to chain calls to other promise methods.

const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Success!');
});

promise1.then((value) => {
  console.log(value);
  // Expected output: "Success!"
});
